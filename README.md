# How To Build a Dragonstaff!

This is how I built a practice Dragonstaff, all the tools, materials and costs (as of 2024).

# The Materials

## Required

The following are required for the basic Dragonstaff. I've included the tools in here, but you can improvise (e.g. using the saw instead of the pipe cutter on the PVC). I've included some alternatives/substitutions below.

- 3m of 20mm PVC Pipe
- 2 x 5-Way Adaptor
- 8 x Caps
- Grip Tape
- Duct Tape
- Broom Handle
- Tape Measure
- Sharpie
- A Saw
- Pipe Cutter
- PVC Glue
- PVC Primer

## Optional

The following are optional. I wanted to be able to screw the heads on/off, but it's not a requirement.

I have found it to be fantastic for portability, and it means you can also make different heads. I had an idea to make an LED head that could be attached here, food for thought.

- 2 x Male Connectors
- 2 x Female Connectors

## Alternatives/Substitutions

### Replacing Glue With Tape

You can choose to use tape like [this](https://youtu.be/TzCRkv11zNc?si=d3mw2NCQ0Ay79t56&t=85) or wrap the end of the pipe with a little bit of tape and try to twist it together. It won't be as durable, but it is cheaper than the PVC glue, which is a bit pricy for how little of it you will use. Anywhere I mention "glue the thing" just replace that with "tape the thing" and you'll be right!

### Sandpaper Is Fine

Rather than using the PVC primer, you can instead use a bit of sandpaper to rough up the PVC. This does work, but your mileage may vary. I used sandpaper my first go around, and all but one of the joins has held firm.

### A Gripping Tale

I used a tennis racket grip on the staff I made, but you can use so many other things. A good one is old bike inner tubes, and good old duct-tape works (though this can come off pretty easily). There are some top-tier materials like [EDM Grip Tape](https://www.threeworlds.com.au/products/epdm-grip) as well, so use what feels good to you.

### It's Also A Contact Staff!

If you do the detachable heads, it means you've also got a contact staff in your hands! Just make a couple of short, weighted heads with some male connectors and you can swap the dragon-heads for contact-heads. Two props in one, what a sweet deal!

### This Thing Hurts!

PVC and bamboo cores are heavy, and I've boffed myself on the head on more than a few occasions. If you don't vibe with concussions, you could get some pool noodles, cut them up and put them on the spokes.

# Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Dry-fit means don't glue! We want to make sure everything feels good before we start joining things together permanently. Gluing will be the absolute last thing we do!

**IMPORTANT**: Follow the old adage of "Measure Twice, Cut Once". Seriously, you don't want to have to buy more pipe because you were in a rush!

## The Heads

1. Mark out where you're going to cut the 8 spokes by marking every 18cm on the PVC pipe.
2. Cut the spokes from the PVC
3. Mark out the weights on the broom handle 
4. Cut the spoke weights from the broom handle (15cm ea)
5. Dry-fit the spokes into the 5-Way connector
6. Secure the weights in the heads with a bit of duct tape
7. Dry-fit the caps on
8. (Optional) Dry-fit the male connector if you're doing detachable heads

## The Core

1. Figure out your desired staff height. I would suggest going longer if you're unsure, as you can always remove more material, you can't add it back on if you go too short.
2. Cut the PVC to your desired length minus 20cm. If you want your staff to be 145cm total length at the end, cut the core to 125cm. This is to account for the length the heads will add.
3. Mark the middle with a sharpie
4. Cut the broom handle to the same length
5. Put the broom handle in the pipe and secure it with a bit of tape
6. Working your way out from the middle of the PVC pipe, apply your chosen grip. We work from the middle for two reasons. First, it provides a good visual reference to the center of balance when you're learning. Second, if choose to shorten the overall length, you can just take an equal amount of pipe off each end and preserve your grip.
7. Dry-fit the heads. (Optional) Use the female connectors if you're doing detachable heads

## The First Test

Now you've got the bones of this together, give it a spin! Yes, it will probably come apart if you drop it, but you can temporarily secure the joint with a bit of duct tape if you need to. Get a feel of the weight, try some rolls and so on. Don't go too wild here, as it's not secure, but you want to get a rough idea of how it feels.

## A Sticky Situation

**IMPORTANT**: Do this outside or somewhere incredibly well ventilated if you're using the glue. This stuff is no joke, you've been warned!

**IMPORTANT**: Do this one join at a time. The time you spend doing this right will be worth it because rushing this process could ruin some of your work (speaking from personal experience here).

Let's glue this all together! Just remember, you can choose to leave some joints unglued for now if you want to be able to make adjustments. For example, I haven't glued the caps onto the spokes for my staff, because I still want to be able to adjust the weights in the head.

1. Use the primer on both ends of the join (or optionally sanding)
2. Wait the required amount of time (instructions on the tin)
3. This next part is quick, you've been warned!
4. Put the glue on the pipe and quickly complete the join
5. Hold for a good 30-60 secs
6. Repeat for the next join, one by one, till you're done

# A Job Well Done

Congratulations, you have your own Dragonstaff! Pat yourself on the back, well done you! Isn't making stuff just the best!!! Enjoy your flow, play around, and have a wicked day!

I'd love to see what you've built, hit me up on [insta](https://www.instagram.com/bearfootdev). Safe travels on your journey!

Here's a bunch of progress shots I took while I was constructing this. Might help give clarity on some of the instructions I wrote!
